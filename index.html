 <h4>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE</h4>
        <p>WASTE NOT, WANT NOT aims to produce and consume goods
in a sustainable pattern, avoid excessive wastage through minimal consumption, reusing, and
recycling whenever possible. This aim makes the producers and consumers more conscious of their
actions and helps change them for the betterment of our planet. </p>
 </div>    
<div class="col-md-4 aim">
    <img src="d.jpg" class="aim-img">
 <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
        <p>As a college, we are taking a
personal initiative to reuse the enormous amounts of paper waste generated in our college ie newspaper to replace
the pre-existing plastic dustbins.Our team strongly believes that if
people start using biodegradable dustbins for dry waste in homes, offices,slums etc. the consumption and
production of plastic dustbins could automatically be reduced. </p>            
            </div>
<div class="col-md-4 aim">
    <img src="Sanitation.jpg" class="aim-img">
 <h4>LONG TERM GOAL</h4>
        <p>Plastic is a major pollutant that accumulates in many regions of our planet.In most of the low income families plastic garbage bags are used to throw trash which in turn pollutes the environment.So, through this bin which is cost effective and eco friendly, we can prevent usage of excess of plastic bins and plastic garbage bags even at the lowest level.

 <p class="plan-title">The process </p>   
    <ul>
    <li>Average life of bins in 1 month,regenerating bin production every month will lead to recycling of 4.152 tonnes of paper </li>
        <li>There are 64 million households in slum</li>
        <li>If every student makes even 2bins per month this number is achievable easily</li>
        <li>If students can take initiative of weekly recycling more bins can be produced that can be used on college campus,domestic use,NGOs,corporate ues</li>
    <li>ONE PAPER BIN====30 PLASTIC BAGS PER MONTH!!!!</li>

 <h4>MLP COLLECTION</h4>
        <p>Multi Layered Plastic collection a. k. a MLPs are those plastics which have a silver lining in them
mostly chips packets. Since college is a hotspot of huge consumption of chips and other packed
products it's the best place to collect such items. These plastic wrappers after collection is given to
Safai Bank, an organization that extracts the silver lining and makes goods out of it like boxes, cases
etc. These wrappers otherwise if tried to burn produc dioxins that are highly poisonous to mankind. </p>

<h1 class="title text-center">OUR STORY</h1>
<div class="row text-center">
<h2 class="text-center">In the middle of diwali vacation of 2019, our first year at Xavier's our zoology teacher presented us with this opportunity of representing the "ECHO" project powered by wwf india, an organisation that is working as a stepping stone towards a sustainable india and students across the nation pitch in their project ideas and on selection the idea is funded and executed nationwide. As first years we were all pumped up , brains intoxicated with the exciting new ideas and a dream to contribute. As we were doing some research we discovered paper waste is a major issue in India, Paper waste in India was 4 million tonnes in 2017-2018, contrary to the 3.2 million tonnes in the previous year. The student force of India is 37.4 million. Another problem was Inadequate sanitation, this remains a leading cause of diarrheal disease and mortality among children in developing countries, particularly in urban slums. If we as young indians take an initiative to recycle the paper into bins and replace the regular plastic bags used to dump garbage on a daily basis, 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste generated on a daily basis can reduce and the only funding here is glue,tape as opposed to plastic bags these paper bins can last for 2 to 3 months and can be distributed in slums, NGOs for free. We are working through ideas for waterproofing of bins and believe that with determination and consistency and support of all our beloved teachers and fellow students we can make a change. 
There were times when we were very close to giving up, all the work had to be stopped due to the unforeseen events that followed in march but each other's support and the cause of our environment's future is what drove us this far and we are now presenting this idea for state summit on june 12.
